And with that neurochemistry comes the feeling of satisfaction. This is the issue. Once you’ve already felt that high, it’s difficult to get back up for the hard fight required to actually earn it. As the saying goes, real bad boys move in silence.",

The next level up is “engagement,” which is defined as a high-flow lifestyle, or one where happiness is achieved not by the pursuit of pleasure but rather through seeking out challenging tasks that have a high likelihood of producing flow. The next level up, the peak level of happiness and the best we get to feel on the planet, is known as “purpose,” which blends the high-flow lifestyle of level two with the desire to impact lives beyond our own.",

People benefit from everyone else’s sacrifices and suffer from their own, so everyone has an incentive to be a free rider and let everyone else make the sacrifice, and everyone suffers. A standard remedy for public goods dilemmas is a coercive authority that can punish free riders. But any government with the totalitarian power to abolish artistic pottery is unlikely to restrict that power to maximizing the common good. One can, alternatively, daydream that moral suasion is potent enough to induce everyone to make the necessary sacrifices. But while humans do have public sentiments, it’s unwise to let the fate of the planet hinge on the hope that billions of people will simultaneously volunteer to act against their interests. Most important, the sacrifice needed to bring carbon emissions down by half and then to zero is far greater than forgoing jewelry: it would require forgoing electricity, heating, cement, steel, paper, travel, and affordable food and clothing.",

If you live in a city where the median salary is $50,000 yearly, talk to a lender and find out how much the average person earning that salary can borrow. Once you have that number (let’s say for this example it’s $250,000), go online and look at what the average house looks like that’s listed at $250,000. If the houses look updated and impressive, there isn’t much incentive for someone to move any farther away. If the houses don’t look updated or impressive, assume that buyers/ tenants will start looking elsewhere. Look around the city and find which neighborhoods have really nice houses and at what price point they are. If you find a pocket where houses listed for $200,000 have beautiful upgrades, bigger yards, more space, etc., you just may have found the next market to appreciate. Understanding how buyers think is crucial to understanding how to determine market value.",

    "Highlight Text": "Then, it’s a great idea to get on Craigslist.org and email a landlord with a unit for rent. Ask them how many applications they’ve received for their rental unit/property. Ask them how long they have had the unit advertised for, and how long they expect it will be before it rents. As a general rule, if the landlord is dismissive of you and doesn’t seem too engaged, they are probably getting lots of attention for the vacant unit. If they are extremely responsive and excited to hear from you, it might mean you are the first or one of the first people to inquire and they don’t feel optimistic about getting many more inquiries.",

No new construction can take place in a city unless the city issues a permit for it to begin. These permits are like “permission slips” that allow home builders to build a property—for a fee, of course. Many cities limit the amount of permits they issue for new construction to avoid too much supply hitting the market at once and having properties sit vacant for too long.",

One study that garnered lots of media attention looked at over six thousand individuals aged forty to forty-five and measured the size of their bellies between 1964 and 1973.11 A few decades later, they were evaluated to see who had developed dementia and how that related to their waist size at the start of the study. The correlation between risk of dementia and thicker midsections twenty-seven years earlier was remarkable: Those with the highest level of abdominal fat had an increased risk of dementia of almost three-fold in comparison to those with the lowest abdominal weight.",

They could forget that blacks, whose sweat was certainly welcome there, couldn’t shop in white stores, or see movies at white theaters, or ride in white railroad cars. They could forget that new laws had caused even the telephone booths in Oklahoma to be segregated. They could forget that whites had larger, nicer, newer schools with all the latest textbooks for their children. They could overlook all these things because of the promise of those Thursday nights—because Greenwood Negroes, probably more so than blacks in any other place in the nation, had everything they needed on the north side of the Frisco tracks.",

Halt before every good which Chance brings to you, in a spirit of doubt and fear; for it is the dumb animals and fish that are deceived by tempting hopes. Do you call these things the 'gifts' of Fortune? They are snares. And any man among you who wishes to live a life of safety will avoid, to the utmost of his power, these limed twigs of her favour, by which we mortals, most wretched in this respect also, are deceived; for we think that we hold them in our grasp, but they hold us in theirs. Such a career leads us into precipitous ways, and life on such heights ends in a fall. Moreover, we cannot even stand up against prosperity when she begins to drive us to leeward; nor can we go down, either, 'with the ship at least on her course,' or once for all; Fortune does not capsize us, – she plunges our bows under and dashes us on the rocks.",

Nevertheless, he desires friends, neighbours, and associates, no matter how much he is sufficient unto himself. And mark how self-sufficient he is; for on occasion he can be content with a part of himself. If he lose a hand through disease or war, or if some accident puts out one or both of his eyes, he will be satisfied with what is left, taking as much pleasure in his impaired and maimed body as he took when it was sound. But while he does not pine for these parts if they are missing, he prefers not to lose them. In this sense the wise man is self-sufficient, that he can do without friends, not that he desires to do without them. When I say \"can,\" I mean this: he endures the loss of a friend with equanimity.",

Metaphors are a great language tool, because they explain the unknown in terms of the known. But they only work if they resonate in the heart of the writer. So I felt a little understaffed here, loving the metaphor when I came upon it, wanting to work with it, and yet not loving to garden.",

    "Highlight Text": "The latter accident occurred during a desperate firefight between the Taliban and American Special Forces. An inexperienced Air Force tactical air controller had just calculated the coordinates of an enemy fighting position and was about to call in an air strike when the batteries died in his precision GPS device, causing its display screen to go dark. Frantically, the air controller put new batteries into the GPS, the numbers flashed back on the screen a moment later, and he directed the B-52 flying overhead to drop its lethal payload on these coordinates. The air controller was unaware, however, that after a battery replacement his GPS automatically defaulted to display the coordinates of its own position. He mistakenly called in these coordinates instead of the Taliban’s position, and the upshot was the first three members of the American military to die in the Afghanistan war were victims of fratricide.",
